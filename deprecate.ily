  use this file to point any user to moved files in openLilyLib.
  Do *not* simple remove the files you want to modify but instead:
  - clear the file
  - include this file (\include "deprecate.ily")
  - use its functions to
    - produce a meaningful error message
    - redirect the include to the new location (if possible)
%}

\include "openlilylib"


% Use this function when the whole file has moved to a new location inside /ly
% and if it can be used the same way there.
% #1: old name
%     can be an arbitrary string indicating as closely as possible which file
%     has been deprecated.
% #2: new-location
%     is the include path relative to /ly.
%     for users who haven't added /ly to their include path this is
%     prepended automatically

   Please update the \\include command to

   For now the new file has been included anyway.
   Please also look at openLilyLib's documentation for setting up the new
   include path settings if you haven't done so already. The given path is
   relative to the \"/ly\" directory inside openLilyLib's root directory.
