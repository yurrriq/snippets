  TODOs and notes:
  ----------------

  Of course I want to eventually add this function as official lily command.

  There should be some easy way of specifying roman font, for example for
  "1st time p, 2nd f" and the like.  I suppose that

  Other things that would be nice to support:
  - text attached to hairpins
  - parenthesized and bracketed dynamics (similar to optional clef transposition)

  Later on, it would be great to have a shorthand for the function -
  for example ! (it fits the context):
  !ppppppppp
  !sfzp
  !"|molto| f"
  !p_espressivo

  A problem: when i \override DynamicText.font-name, only the font of the
  additional text should change.  Currently, the dynamic letter itself changes.
